# Reading List

The existence of this project came from two apprenticeship patterns introduced by Dave Hoover: _Reading List_ and _Record What You Learn_. My goals:

1. Track what I'm reading to find gaps in my knowledge
2. Document my thoughts on books
3. Use GitHub wikis as an easy knowledge-store
4. List podcasts and other resources I use to gain knowledge
5. Learn. And help others learn.

If you have any suggestions or want to discuss any of the books, hit me up on twitter [@corymonty][1].

## Podcasts

[**Build and Analyze**][1] by Marco Arment and Dan Benjamin

> Got into this podcast because I love Instapaper and Marco provides some great insight on PHP and iPhone development. Not just about writing code, but about dealing with Apple, customers, and coffee. Staple in my playlist. 

[**The Big Web Show**][2] by Jeffery Zeldman and Dan Benjamin

> Mostly an interview show where Jeffery converses with someone doing something totally innovative on the web using standards. Awesome to keep current on the ever-changing technologies on the web.

[**Talk Show**][3] by John Gruber and Dan Benjamin

> John Gruber provides brillant analysis on today's tech stories. They also do this sweet James Bond review at the end of the show.

[**Hypercritical**][4] by John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin

> Super-critical, nothing is perfect views on the tech and web industry. Can get a bit overbearing to hear someone complain for an hour straight, but gives you some different angles to think about.

[**The Pipeline**][5] by Dan Benjamin

> Solo interview show with a wide-range of topics. Good resource to step out of the web and software industry sometimes.

[**The Ruby Show**][6] by Peter Cooper and Jason Seifer

> Combined with Ruby5, these two podcasts are a great way to keep up with Ruby, Rails, and the surrounding communities.

[**Back to Work**][7] by Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin

> Chaotic show, but dives into topics to assist focus and growth as you work. A lot of fun.

[**Let's Make Mistakes**][8] by Mike Monteiro and Katie Gillum

> Have only listened to two episodes so far, but Mike and Katie are pretty down-to-earth designers giving a different viewpoint on the web.

[**Ruby5**][9] by Envy Labs

> Ruby news in 5 minutes. Awesome.

[**VimCasts**][10] by Drew Neil

> I'm a n00b in Vim (as of 5/11) so a natural place to learn some vim.
