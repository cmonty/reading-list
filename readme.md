# Reading List

The existence of this project came from two apprenticeship patterns introduced by Dave Hoover: _Reading List_ and _Record What You Learn_. My goals:

1. Track what I'm reading to find gaps in my knowledge
2. Document my thoughts on books
3. Use GitHub wikis as an easy knowledge-store
4. List podcasts and other resources I use to gain knowledge
5. Learn. And help others learn.

If you have any suggestions or want to discuss any of the books, hit me up on twitter [@corymonty][1].
