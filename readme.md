# Reading List

The purpose of this repo is to accomplish two apprenticeship patterns introduced by Dave Hoover: _Reading List_ and _Record What You Learn_. My goals are to:

1. Track what I'm reading to find gaps in knowledge
2. Document my thoughts on the book
3. Use GitHub wikis as an easy knowledge-store
4. List podcasts and other resources I use to gain knowledge
5. Learn. And help others learn

If you have any suggestions to add or want to discuss any of the books, hit me up on twitter @corymonty
